Highlights :
  1. When the 'Start' button is pressed quiz starts with the timer
  2. Questions are presented to the user until the available time is zero or question count in the pool is zero.
  3. Once the user clicks an answer, result is displayed.
  4. When all questions are answered or availble time is zero, user is presented to save the score.
  5. Marks are saved in local storage, and if there are any marks are saved already, they are loaded in view_highscore.html.

## Technical Acceptance - Work Done
